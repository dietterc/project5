## Spy idea

#### Roles
spies   
a mole   
security officer   
 
spy operator 

#### Idea
A team of spies are attempting to rob a large corporation, they win by completing an objective then escaping without being caught or time running out. Among the spies is a mole, the moles objective is to stop the spies from winning the game. The mole can stop the spies through stalling them, or feeding information to the security officer. The mole is unknown to the spies AND the security officer. The security officers objective is to stop the spies. This can be done by delaying them (like the mole) or calling the police. The police can only be called once enough proof has been gathered by the security guard. Proof includes; finding the identity of the spies, gathering evidence that a crime will take place, getting the crime caught on camera.  
The security officer is not an actual player character. They operate from the security office and cannot leave. They have a view of the map, however only a number of areas can be viewed at the same time.
